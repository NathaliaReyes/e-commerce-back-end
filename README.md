## Description
E-commerce is a project that focuses on the design and implementation of a back-end infrastructure for an e-commerce website. It implements the power of Express.js, a fast, useful, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, to build the API.

The API interacts with a PostgreSQL database using Sequelize, a promise-based Node.js ORM. This project serves as a powerful tool for managing different aspects of an e-commerce site, including products, categories, and tags. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD operations) these entities, making it a comprehensive solution for back-end e-commerce management.

## Installation

To install this application, you'll need Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <https://github.com/NathaliaReyes/e-commerce-back-end.git>` or `git clone <git@github.com:NathaliaReyes/e-commerce-back-end.git>`.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository in your terminal `cd e-commerce-back-end`.
3. Install the necessary npm packages by running `npm install`.
4. Ensure you have a PostgreSQL server running and accessible (change credentials-username, password..).
5. Set up your database by running the provided schema file in your PostgreSQL client `psql -U <username>` and `\i db/schema.sql`.
6. Seed the database, `node seeds/index.js`.
7. Start the application by running `node <server.js>` in your terminal.

Please refer to the `Usage` section for more details on how to use the application.

## Usage

This application provides a back-end for an e-commerce site. You can test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or Insomnia.

The API has endpoints for three different categories: Products, Categories, and Tags. Each category has endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. Go to the Assets file and find the POSTMAN collection file, run the file in the software and follow instructions below:

- **Products**: Use the `/api/products` endpoint to create and read products. You can also use `/api/products/:id` endpoint to read, update, or delete on a specific product.

- **Categories**: Use the `/api/categories` endpoint to create and  read categories. You can also use `/api/categories/:id` endpoint to read, update, or delete on a specific category.

- **Tags**: Use the `/api/tags` endpoint to create and read tags. You can also use `/api/tags/:id` endpoint to read, update, or delete on a specific tag.

Remember to replace `:id` with the actual id of the product, category, or tag you want to operate on.

To start the application, run `node server.js` in your terminal.
